    A convenience class for managing dictionaries that represent Mason
    objects. It provides nice shorthands for inserting some of the more
    elements into the object but mostly is just a parent for the much more
    useful subclass defined next. This class is generic in the sense that it
    does not contain any application specific implementation details.

        Adds an error element to the object. Should only be used for the root
        object, and only in error scenarios.

        Note: Mason allows more than one string in the @messages property (it's
        in fact an array). However we are being lazy and supporting just one
        message.
